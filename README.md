# EDA using SweetViz

Data visualization is very important to get insights on the dataset, I have found an article by Francois Bertrand in medium. And I want to explore the features of this library and review them.
The article is under the following link:

He used the titanic dataset I will do an exploration using the Red Wine Quality dataset found in the UCI repository under this link: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

The dataset is related to the red wine variant of a Portuguese wine brand called "Vinho Verde". It is a dataset provided to achieve tasks of Classification and Regression. It contains 12 Real Attributes related to the composition of the wine.

I used Jupyter Notebook to test the library. 

# My honest review:
I loved the simplicity of usage of this library. I believe that Francois made a great work on the graphics generated it's a near complete exploration of all the statistical aspects of the data.
NB: The library only works with float and boolean data.

- The library generates an .html report (you'll find it in the docs).
- I like the correlation graphic that shows whenyou click on associations.
- I like that we can compare between the Train and the test sets.
